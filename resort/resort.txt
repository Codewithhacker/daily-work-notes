Final Changes in Subdomain Website:-

Change secure login theme as eService Apartments.

Top 12 Amenities need to be displayed in Facilities @ Service Apartment name required.

3.    Customize Home Options - Footer (Title / Heading, Name / Keyword with Manual link required). Book Now & Pay Now need to have a manual link.   

Link of Youtube & Google Map not connected to frontend Home page & Contact Us pages respectively. 

4.    About Us (frontend) – same Photo displaying twice. Link displaying after About Us.

5. Accommodation – Display contents below Room Type in Accommodation page. Each Room Type needs to have Title, Keywords, descriptions & URL for that particular Room Type for better SEO.

Room Facility can be taken from the Amenities option. Pricing in Dollar - $ need to change in Rupees – R.

Check Availability Form not working. This needs to connect to the Enquiry Form to submit enquiry which needs to connect with email as well as Admin Enquiry option.
